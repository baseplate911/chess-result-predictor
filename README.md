Chess Game Outcome Prediction Model
üìù Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end data science and full-stack web application designed to predict the outcome of a chess game from any given board position. It demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow, from data acquisition and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and deployment as a live web service.

The primary goal was to build a robust model capable of analyzing a chess board and predicting one of three outcomes: White Win, Black Win, or Draw.

üöÄ Key Features
Machine Learning Model: A Random Forest Classifier trained to predict game outcomes with over 91% accuracy.

Advanced Feature Engineering: The model uses a rich set of custom-engineered features derived from a FEN string, including a 64-element board vector, material advantage, and king safety scores.

Class Imbalance Handling: The training data was balanced using SMOTE to ensure the model could accurately predict rare outcomes like "Draw."

Full-Stack Application: A Flask backend serves the predictive model via a REST API, with a responsive React frontend for user interaction.

Deployment: The application is deployed on Render, making the model accessible as a live web service.

üíª Technologies Used
Backend: Python, Flask, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, joblib, python-chess, imblearn

Frontend: React, HTML, CSS

Deployment: Git, GitHub, Render

üìä Dataset
The model was trained on a comprehensive dataset of over 60,000 game positions derived from public PGN files. This large dataset provided a rich and diverse set of examples for the model to learn from, ensuring its high performance.

üéØ Future Improvements
Model Refinement: Explore more advanced models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are excellent at recognizing spatial patterns on a chessboard.

Real-time Analysis: Integrate the Lichess API to allow for real-time analysis of ongoing games.

Expanded Features: Add more intricate chess features, such as pawn structure, controlled squares, and piece mobility, to further improve model accuracy.
